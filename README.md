# Local File Server

A nice way to view your local filesystem in a browser. The backend is a simple
Node application and the frontend is a single-page Backbone application.

## Setup

The only non-standard dependency for the server is [Jade], so you'll need to run
`npm install jade` inside the project directory first.

All you need to do then is run `node server.js`, and visit
<http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

[Jade]: http://jade-lang.com/
